# Financial Forecasting using Deep Learning

This repository contains the colab file for the different methods we tried for predicting time series data.

* Using Traditional LSTM.
* Encoding the time series data using GADF encoding and then predicting.
* Using a DL based method to encode the time series data into images.

From the above methods that we tried, we were able to show that using GADF encoding for time-series data and then using CNN and LSTM architecture after that led to better results than simply training the data on traditional LSTMs.
